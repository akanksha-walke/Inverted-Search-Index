## Overview

An index data structure that stores a mapping from content—like words or numbers—to its places in a database file, document, or collection of documents is called an inverted index.  When a document is uploaded to the database, an inverted index is used to enable quick full-text searches at the expense of more processing.  Instead of the database file's index, the inverted file can be the database file itself.  The most widely used data structure in document retrieval systems, such as search engines, is this one.

## OPERATIONS

## Technologies used

C language – Functions, File I/O operations, File pointers, string operations,Structures.
Data Structures – Hashing and Linked List.

## Printing Pattern
Display the index number and details as follows -> 
[index_no] <file_count> <word_count>

## Saving Pattern
Store the contents in given pattern:

1. #<index_no>;
2. ;<file_count>;<file_name>;<word_count>#

## Compilation
Compile the program using a C compiler. 

For example:

   1. gcc * .c
   2. ./a.out
